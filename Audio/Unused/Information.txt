Inky was an experiment with the concept of music transforming from one thing to another. So, it starts out all dark and creepy, then it turns into something nice. It was never meant to be used in-game.

As it turns out, the high intensity is an arrangement of Brandenburg Concerto No. 3 in G Major by Bach.



Toxic was an experiment to show how the music system could potentially work with licensed music.

It, of course, was never meant to be in-game. (Also, since the colour sounds don't work properly, I made educated guesses for the folders with colour names based on what the instrument is in almost every used track in both games. For the ones without colour names, their colour was never consistent.)

There are normally stems of the instrumental and vocals of the actual Toxic, but I've removed them to be safe, and also because who cares about those, this is de Blob.
