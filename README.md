## Features

- All 25 in-game selectable moods from De Blob & De Blob 2
- 3 Unused Tracks
- The ability to either mix individual audio stems or select a preset which has the stems mixed as they are in-game


## Planned Features

- add boss themes Mongo and Comrade Black

- add prototype unused color sounds for tracks that have them:

        - Tranquil
        - Steppin'
        - Riotous
        - Pan-Galactic
        - Mungo
        - Fizzy
        - Chilled

- add prototype stems for tracks where they mix well with the rest of the stems

        - Riotous
        - Mungo
        & potentially more

- sync the color sounds with the music & add a way to occasionally automatically play them 
- use only the color sounds with correct pitch in de Blob 1 tracks






## How can I help?
